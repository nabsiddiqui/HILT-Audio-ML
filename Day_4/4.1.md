# Day 4, Session 1
### 9:00 – 10:30 am

#### CSV I/O in Python
Paste the following code snippet into a new Jupyter notebook, change "yourname" to your username on your computer (e.g. "tclement"), run the cell. 

```python
import csv

csv_path="/Users/yourname/Desktop/Artists.csv"
artist_table=[]

o = open(csv_path,'rU')
mydata = csv.reader(o)

for row in mydata:
 artist_table.append(row)

o.close()

artist_header=artist_table[0]
artist_table.remove(artist_table[0])

artist_header
```

Check the length of the table, then enter an index value in brackets to look at an entry.

```python
len(artist_table)
artist_table[6310]
```

We’ve just copied all the data from a CSV-formatted spreadsheet and turned it into a format Python can easily work with: a list of lists of strings. Let’s walk through the above a step at a time, this time loading MoMa’s artwork metadata. 

We began by importing the `csv` module, Python’s built-in CSV input/output tool. Note, since you've already done it above, you don't have to do it again.

```python
   import csv
```
Next we assign our pathname to the `artwork_path` variable and initialize an empty list called `artwork_table`. This will become our list of lists, Python’s version of a table. Add the below to your open notebook, again replacing `yourname` with your user name.

```python
   artwork_path="/Users/yourname/Desktop/Artworks.csv"
   artwork_table=[]
```

Then we create a file stream object `o` that points to our spreadsheet, including the argument `rU` to specify that we’ll be reading the file and expecting text. We pass our file object to `csv`’s constructor function and assign the new reader object to `mydata`.

```python
   second_csv = open(artwork_path,'rU')
   mydata = csv.reader(second_csv)
```
Using a for loop, we iterate through our csv object and add each row (represented by a list) to the master list `meta_table`.

```python   
for row in mydata:
artwork_table.append(row)
second_csv.close()
```
Because this table uses column labels in the first row, we’ll save those labels to the variable `header` and remove it from the table.

```python
artwork_header=artwork_table[0]
artwork_table.remove(artwork_table[0])
```

Finally, let’s look at our list of column titles …

```python
artwork_header
```

… as well as a row in our table.

```python
artwork_table[60946]
```

 **Tip:** Python will ignore any text following the “#” character on a line, which we can use to add explanatory comments within our code. Here are a couple lines from the snippet above followed by example notes. 

```python
header=meta_table[0] #saves list of column titles to variable 'header'
meta_table.remove(meta_table[0]) #removes column titles from table
```
#### Writing CSVs
Now that we’ve filtered and sorted our metadata, let’s export it to a new CSV file called `art_1960s.csv`.

```python
outpath="/Users/yourname/Desktop/art_1960s.csv"
o = open(outpath, 'w')
a = csv.writer(o)
a.writerows([artwork_header])
a.writerows(art_1960s_sorted)
o.close()
```
Note that we call use `writerows` function twice, first writing the column headers and then the actual data. Because `writerows` only accepts lists of lists, we’ve enclosed the `header` list object in brackets to create a new list that only contains `header`.

Find the new file on your desktop and open it in Excel or Calc. Take a few moments to explore the collection.
#### The Dictionary Data Type
So far, when we want to access the “Artist” field in MoMA’s metadata, we’ve been referring to its position in a given row.

```python
row=art_1960s_sorted[7700]
row[1]
```
 _Output:_

 ```python
'Helen Frankenthaler'
```

This system is straightforward and well-suited for many jobs, but for large, complex projects it can be difficult to keep track of all those index numbers. Instead, we can use a dictionary to reference metadata fields by name rather than list index.




Just like we can refer to a item in a list using brackets to enclose its position in the list, a dictionary, or dict, uses strings or numbers to identify each item in a collection. This data structure is known as a key-value pair. Here’s the simplest way to create a new dictionary.

```python
artist_meta={}
artist_meta['xefxbbxbfConstituentID']=248
artist_meta['DisplayName']='Richard Avedon'
artist_meta['ArtistBio']='American, 1923–2004'
artist_meta['Nationality']='American'
artist_meta['Gender']='Male'
artist_meta['BeginDate']=1923
artist_meta['EndDate']=2004
artist_meta['Wiki QID']='Q305497'
artist_meta['ULAN']='500013773'
```
The following is a more compact format for the same key-value assignment.

```python
artist_meta={'xefxbbxbfConstituentID': 248, 'DisplayName': 'Richard Avedon', 'Gender': 'Male', 'BeginDate': 1923, 'EndDate': 2004, 'ULAN': '500013773', 'Wiki QID': 'Q305497', 'ArtistBio': 'American, 1923xe2x80x932004', 'Nationality': 'American'}
```
To access a value, enter its key between brackets like so.

```python
artist_meta['DisplayName']
```
And note that you can iterate over a dict to view and/or use its keys.

```python
for key in artist_meta:
 print key + " - " + str(artist_meta[key])  
```
Next, let’s create a dict for each artist MoMA’s artist metadata. Here’s a snippet (repeated from above) that loads `Artists.csv` as a list of lists called `artist_table`.

```python
import csv
csv_path="/Users/yourname/Desktop/Artists.csv"
artist_table=[]

o = open(csv_path,'rU')
mydata = csv.reader(o)
for row in mydata:
 artist_table.append(row)

o.close()
artist_header=artist_table[0]
artist_table.remove(artist_table[0])
```
Now we’ll use a for loop to iterate through `artist_table`, converting each list of cells to key-value format.

```python
artist_dicts=[]

for row in artist_table:
artist_meta={}
artist_meta['xefxbbxbfConstituentID']=row[0]
artist_meta['DisplayName']=row[1]
artist_meta['ArtistBio']=row[2]
artist_meta['Nationality']=row[3]
artist_meta['Gender']=row[4]
artist_meta['BeginDate']=int(row[5])
artist_meta['EndDate']=int(row[6])
artist_meta['Wiki QID']=row[7]
artist_meta['ULAN']=row[8]
artist_dicts.append(artist_meta)
```  

The list `artist_dicts` should now contain records for about 15,000 artists.

```python
len(artist_dicts)
```
Specifying an index in brackets will return a dict object.

```python
artist_dicts[12007]
```
And we can use one of our standard key names to get a particular value.

```python
artist_dicts[12007]['DisplayName']
```

If we want to create a list of artist names, birth years, etc., we can thus iterate through the `artists_dicts` list and specify the field we want by name.

#### Working with JSON
JSON data is a representation of key-value pairs, very much like a dictionary in Python. For the following example we’ll download a JSON version of the artwork metadata we’ve been working with.

```python
import urllib2
url="https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/blob/master/Artworks.json?raw=true"
json_string=urllib2.urlopen(url).read()
json_data = json.loads(json_string)
```
To view JSON data (as well as dictionaries and just about any other data format), Python offers a “pretty printer” module. There are also numerous online tools for prettifying JSON data, such as [these](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/) [two](http://json.parser.online.fr/beta/).

```python
import pprint
pprint.pprint(json_data)
```
To examine the top-level keys in our JSON data, enter the following.

```python
for key in json_data:
print key
```
 _Output_:

```python
records
meta
```
In this case, the “records” key points to a list of item records. The following will return the first record.
print json_data['records'][0]

 _Output_:

```python
{u'pk': 19579, u'model': u'collection.museumobject', u'fields': {u'primary_image_id': u'2006AJ6728', u'object': u'Cabinet', u'year_start': 1600, u'artist': u'Fiamengo, Iacopo', u'museum_number': u'W.36:1, 2-1981', u'rights': 3, u'object_number': u'O61539', u'last_processed': u'2016-04-30 02:11:57', u'event_text': u'', u'collection_code': u'FWK', u'place': u'Naples', u'longitude': u'14.25185000', u'last_checked': u'2016-04-30 02:11:57', u'museum_number_token': u'w361981', u'latitude': u'40.83990100', u'title': u'', u'date_text': u'about 1600 (Made)nca. 1600 (made)', u'slug': u'cabinet-fiamengo-iacopo', u'sys_updated': u'2015-12-11 00:00:00', u'location': u'Europe 1600-1815, room 6, case CA11'}}
```

A record, in turn, contains three keys: “pk,” “model,” and “fields.”

```python
print json_data['records'][0]
```
 _Output:_

```python
pk
model
fields
```
The metadata we’re interested in is under “fields.” 
```python
for key in json_data['records'][0]['fields']:
print key
```
```python
 _Output:_
primary_image_id
object
year_start
artist
museum_number
rights
object_number
last_processed
event_text
collection_code
place
longitude
last_checked
museum_number_token
latitude
title
date_text
slug
sys_updated
location
```
We can thus view the “artist” field like so.
print json_data['records'][0]['fields']['artist']
