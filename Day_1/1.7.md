# Day 1, Session 4
### 2:45 â€“ 4:30 pm

## Python introduction

<!-- possibly continuing Bash intro from before lunch -->

<!-- Go through the beginning of this together. -->


Open a new terminal window in Jupyter ([link](http://localhost:8888/terminals/99)). Type `python` and hit return to launch the Python shell. You can tell you're in the Python shell (as opposed to Bash) by the `>>>` characters to the left of your cursor.

```
python
```

Let's do a little math. Enter the following and hit return.

```
1+1
```

Now let's print a string.

```
print('1337 skillz')
```

Python's shell (also known as a REPL, or read-eval-print loop) is great for getting a feel for the language and completing small tasks. For most of this course, however, we'll be using Jupyter's notebook interface. Type `quit()` and hit return to go back to the Bash shell.

```python
quit()
```

Now use `wget` to download the notebook file we'll be using for the rest of this session.


```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevemclaugh/HILT-Audio-ML/master/Day_1/1.7%20Python%20Introduction.ipynb
```

Return to Jupyter's home screen ([link](http://localhost:8888)) and you should see [1.3 Python Introduction.ipynb](1.3 Python Introduction.ipynb). (You may need to refresh the page.) Click on it to launch the notebook.
