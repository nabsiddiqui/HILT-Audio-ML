## Command-line introduction
<!-- (11:30–12:00) -->

<!-- People will work on their own. -->

<!-- We can continue after lunch if people are taking a while. -->


### Getting started

In Jupyter, click `New`, then `Terminal` in the upper right to launch a new terminal window. Before we go further, you may find it helpful to open the following cheat sheet in your browser: Unix/Linux Command Reference ()(http://cc.iiti.ac.in/lcommands.pdf).

First, a few notes on semantics. While in many cases we can use the terms “command line,” “terminal,” and “shell” interchangeably, each denotes something slightly different.

“**Command line**” has the broadest scope, referring to a general style of interface. A command-line interface (CLI), also known as a command-line interpreter, is any system in which all interaction occurs via text-based commands issued through a keyboard.

A **terminal**, or more accurately a terminal emulator, is an application in your local operating system that essentially just provides a window to type in. We're using Jupyter's terminal through the browser so that everyone in the class is on the same page. Most macOS users use [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)), while [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) is a popular option for Windows users who prefer a Unix-style interface to the DOS command prompt. In most versions of Linux, pressing `Ctrl+Alt+T` will launch a new terminal window.

In your terminal window, type the following and press return. (Note that there is a space after `echo`.)

```
echo $SHELL
```

A **shell** is the software layer between user input and the rote world of file system maintenance. A graphical user interface (GUI) like macOS or Windows is technically considered a shell, but if someone refers to “the shell” they typically mean a command-line interpreter such as [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)).

The command you entered above returns `/bin/bash`, which is the location of Bash’s “binary,” or machine-readable application file.

### The file system

Unix-like operating systems are based on a metaphor: a nested set of directories and data files, forming a tree structure that begins at the root directory `/`. A benefit of this arrangement is that each file can be uniquely identified using a pathname of the following format:`/directory1/directory2/directory3/file.txt`. Our Docker container is running Ubuntu Linux, which has a separate file system from the primary operating system you're using (macOS, Windows, GUI-based Linux, etc.). The exception is `sharedfolder`, which is a shared volume between the two operating systems.

In a shell session, at any given moment a user metaphorically occupies a particular "working directory" within this greater tree structure. Enter the `pwd` ("print working directory") command to see your current location.

```
pwd
```

For convenience, our Docker container always starts us off in `/home/sharedfolder` by default.

The root directory, `/`, is just like any other folder in the system. Enter the following to change your working directory to root.

```
cd /
```

You won't get any obvious feedback, but you'll notice the location indicted to the left of your cursor has changed. You can view the contents of the current directory with the `ls` command.

```
ls
```

![](img/cli01.png)

You should see a list of directories including "bin," "boot," "dev", and so on. Add the `-l` option and you’ll see more information on each file.

```
ls -l
```

![](img/cli02.png)

You can find dozens of other options in the manual for `ls`, which you can launch like so.

```
man ls
```

Use the arrow keys to scroll, then press `q` to return to the shell. You can launch so-called "man pages" this way for most command-line programs installed on your system.

### Bash interface tips

Now let's return to our shared folder.

```
cd /home/sharedfolder
```

If you haven't already done so, enter the following command to download a set of sample audio files.  

```bash
wget -i http://www.stephenmclaughlin.net/HILT/Day_1/1.1_files.txt
```

Now use `ls` to list the files in the current directory.

We can use `du` (short for "disk usage") to check the size of a file in bytes. Try adding the `-h` option after `du` to get the size in a more human-readable format.

```
du sine_440.wav
```

Tab completion is a useful feature of most Unix-like CLIs. If you type the first few letters of a long filename, pressing tab will automatically fill in the rest (as long as there's only one file in the directory beginning with those letters). Type out the following, then press tab to finish the filename.

```
du My
```

![](img/cli03.png)

You'll note that every space in the filename is preceded by a backslash; these are called **escaped** spaces. Because Bash uses spaces to indicate boundaries between each element of a command, the backslash makes it clear that the following space is part of the filename.

Press return to run that command. Just for fun, let's see what happens when we don't escape our spaces.

```
du Myles - Philly ICA - 2010 - interstitial.mp3
```

![](img/cli04.png)

The `du` tool looks for a file called `Myles`, then one called `-`, and so on. As an alternative, we can use quotation marks to make it explicit that the filename, including spaces, is a single chunk.

```
du "Myles - Philly ICA - 2010 - interstitial.mp3"
```

To make your life easier, you may want to avoid using spaces in the names of files you create. The underscore (`_`) is a good alternative.

Now enter the same command followed by `&&` and press return.

```
du "Myles - Philly ICA - 2010 - interstitial.mp3" &&
```

![](img/cli05.png)

Nothing happens! You're stuck in command-line limbo, and pressing return repeatedly doesn't help. If this sort of thing happens by mistake, press `Ctrl+c` (i.e., the `Ctrl` or `control` key and the `c` key at the same time).  This will cancel what you've just entered and bring you back to the regular command prompt. (Incidentally, `&&` is used to string together multiple commands, usually in the same line.)

You may wonder why we're spending so much time on these fiddly Bash details in a course on audio machine learning. The reason is that these non-intuitive interface quirks can be *very* frustrating for beginners — and most programming don't mention them, leaving students to figure them out by trial and error.



### ExifTool and moving files around

[ExifTool](http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) is a great CLI program for reading and writing metadata for a wide range of media file formats. Enter the following command to view information about the MP3 file we've been working with. Because the output won't all fit in the terminal window, note that you can scroll up to see the rest.

```
exiftool "Myles - Philly ICA - 2010 - interstitial.mp3"
```

![](img/cli06.png)

In Unix-like systems, we can use the the `>` operator to write terminal output to disk. The following command will create a new text file called `Myles_metadata.txt`.

```
exiftool "Myles - Philly ICA - 2010 - interstitial.mp3" > Myles_metadata.txt
```

Note that you don't get any feedback in the terminal. Go to your desktop and open `sharedfolder`, then open the new file in your text editor of choice.

You can also use the `cat` tool to quickly view a file's contents in the terminal.

```
cat Myles_metadata.txt
```

In addition to `cat`, several other useful CLI tools for viewing text files are `head`, `tail`, and `less`. Try them all if you like. When using `less`, you can press `q` to return to the command prompt.

If you use `>` with a filename that already exists, you'll simply overwrite that file. Using `>>` instead will add your new output to the end of the existing file. The following command will run `exiftool` on all files in the current directory and write the output to a single text file.

```
exiftool * >> All_metadata.txt
```

We can also add text to the beginning and/or end of the `*` wildcard operator to filter by filename.

```
exiftool *.wav >> All_WAV_metadata.txt
```

```
exiftool *.mp3 >> All_MP3_metadata.txt
```

Now let's make a new directory and move those text files into it. The following command creates a directory called `ExifTool_metadata`.

```
mkdir ExifTool_metadata
````

We can use the `mv` tool to move a single file into the new directory.

```
mv All_metadata.txt ExifTool_metadata
```

Or we can move every file ending in ".txt" like so.

```bash
mv *.txt ExifTool_metadata
```

Now let's `cd` into our new directory and view its contents.

```
cd ExifTool_metadata
ls
```
![](img/cli07.png)

A useful shortcut is `../`, which refers to the parent directory of our current location on the file tree. Let’s use it to `cd` back to `sharedfolder`.

```
cd ../
```

Finally, we’ll delete the directory we just created along with its contents. Entering `rm` followed by a filename will delete that file; adding the `-r` option tells it to remove files recursively, meaning everything in the specified folder gets wiped out.

```
rm -r ExifTool_metadata
```

Be careful with `rm`, especially in recursive mode. It deletes files permanently rather than sending them to a Trash folder, so a small mistake can really ruin your day.




## FFmpeg

FFmpeg will become your best friend.

You may want to keep this [cheat sheet](https://www.cheatography.com/thetartankilt/cheat-sheets/ffmpeg/pdf_bw/) handy.


Basic format:

```
ffmpeg -i filename.wav filename.mp3
```



Convert all MP3s in a directory to mono 16/44.1 WAVs:


```bash
cd /path/to/directory

for file in *.mp3; do
ffmpeg -i $file -acodec pcm_s16le -ac 1 `basename "$file" .mp3`.wav;
done
```




Next, we’ll extract a 90-second segment from the video using [FFmpeg](#). The `-ss` option specifies start time and `-t` is the length of our new excerpt. In this case we’re creating a 90-second clip beginning 10 minutes, 11 seconds into the film.  This may take a few minutes.

    ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -ss 00:10:11.0 -t 00:01:30.0 Bucket_clip.mp4

![](week/1/Image-13.png)

Instead of HH:MM:SS.S notation, we can also specify start time and/or length using seconds. The following command produces the same output as the one above.

    ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -ss 701 -t 90 Bucket_clip.mp4

To re-encode a video clip when you make an excerpt, you can include the `-c copy` option.

    ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -c copy -ss 00:10:11.0 -t 00:01:30.0 Bucket_clip.mp4

When FFmpeg is finished, open `Bucket_clip.mp4` in VLC Media Player and see how it turned out. You may notice missing video frames or other errors.

![](week/1/Image-14.png)

As usual, entering `man ffmpeg` will display the program’s manual.












#### Download a Web page from the shell
Begin by `cd`ing to Desktop.

cd ~/Desktop

Then enter `wget` followed by any URL.

wget http://google.com

![](week/1/Image-9.png)

If you’re connected to the Internet and Wget is installed correctly, you should see feedback in the shell that looks something like the above. In this case, Wget has saved Google’s "index.html" file to the desktop. Either view the file in the shell using `less` or open it in TextWrangler.

![](week/1/Image-10.png)

To make the file more readable in TextWrangler, go to the toolbar and select `View > Text Display > Soft Wrap Text`.

Wget is an amazingly versatile tool, and we’ll return to it in later weeks. In the meantime, the manual is worth a skim.

man wget

#### **9.** Download a video with youtube-dl and create an excerpt with FFmpeg <!-- Note: this takes a while. -->
First, install **youtube-dl** and **FFmpeg** using Homebrew.

brew install youtube-dl
brew install ffmpeg

`cd` to Desktop and pass a YouTube URL to `youtube-dl`. We’ll be downloading *A Bucket of Blood*, Roger Corman’s 1959 black comedy about beatnik culture (which happens to be in the public domain). The file will be around 300 MB, so you can substitute a shorter YouTube video if you’re close to your wi-fi bandwidth limit.

cd ~/Desktop
youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEzoCoIolJ0

![](week/1/Image-11.png)

To simplify things, locate the video in Finder and change its name to `Bucket.mp4`. Now let’s look at the file’s metadata with ExifTool.

exiftool Bucket.mp4

![](week/1/Image-12.png)

Use the `--help` option to view ExifTool’s man page, which you can also find here ()(#). Press `q` to exit the manual viewer.

exiftool --help

Next, we’ll extract a 90-second segment from the video using FFmpeg ()(#). The `-ss` option specifies start time and `-t` is the length of our new excerpt. In this case we’re creating a 90-second clip beginning 10 minutes, 11 seconds into the film.  This may take a few minutes.

ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -ss 00:10:11.0 -t 00:01:30.0 Bucket*clip.mp4

![](week/1/Image-13.png)

Instead of HH:MM:SS.S notation, we can also specify start time and/or length using seconds. The following command produces the same output as the one above.

ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -ss 701 -t 90 Bucket*clip.mp4

To re-encode a video clip when you make an excerpt, you can include the `-c copy` option.

ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -c copy -ss 00:10:11.0 -t 00:01:30.0 Bucket*clip.mp4

When FFmpeg is finished, open `Bucket_clip.mp4` in VLC Media Player and see how it turned out. You may notice missing video frames or other errors.

![](week/1/Image-14.png)

As usual, entering `man ffmpeg` will display the program’s manual.
