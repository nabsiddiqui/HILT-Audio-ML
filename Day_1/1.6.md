# A few fundamental tools

## FFmpeg

FFmpeg will become your best friend.

You may want to keep this [cheat sheet](https://www.cheatography.com/thetartankilt/cheat-sheets/ffmpeg/pdf_bw/) handy.


Basic format:

```
ffmpeg -i filename.wav filename.mp3
```



Convert all MP3s in a directory to mono 16/44.1 WAVs:


```bash
cd /path/to/directory

for file in *.mp3; do
ffmpeg -i $file -acodec pcm_s16le -ac 1 `basename "$file" .mp3`.wav;
done
```




Next, we’ll extract a 90-second segment from the video using [FFmpeg](#). The `-ss` option specifies start time and `-t` is the length of our new excerpt. In this case we’re creating a 90-second clip beginning 10 minutes, 11 seconds into the film.  This may take a few minutes.

    ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -ss 00:10:11.0 -t 00:01:30.0 Bucket_clip.mp4

Instead of HH:MM:SS.S notation, we can also specify start time and/or length using seconds. The following command produces the same output as the one above.

    ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -ss 701 -t 90 Bucket_clip.mp4

To re-encode a video clip when you make an excerpt, you can include the `-c copy` option.

    ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -c copy -ss 00:10:11.0 -t 00:01:30.0 Bucket_clip.mp4

When FFmpeg is finished, open `Bucket_clip.mp4` in VLC Media Player and see how it turned out. You may notice missing video frames or other errors.

As usual, entering `man ffmpeg` will display the program’s manual.












#### Download a Web page from the shell
Begin by `cd`ing to Desktop.

cd ~/Desktop

Then enter `wget` followed by any URL.

wget http://google.com

![](week/1/Image-9.png)

If you’re connected to the Internet and Wget is installed correctly, you should see feedback in the shell that looks something like the above. In this case, Wget has saved Google’s "index.html" file to the desktop. Either view the file in the shell using `less` or open it in TextWrangler.

![](week/1/Image-10.png)

To make the file more readable in TextWrangler, go to the toolbar and select `View > Text Display > Soft Wrap Text`.

Wget is an amazingly versatile tool, and we’ll return to it in later weeks. In the meantime, the manual is worth a skim.

man wget

#### **9.** Download a video with youtube-dl and create an excerpt with FFmpeg <!-- Note: this takes a while. -->
First, install **youtube-dl** and **FFmpeg** using Homebrew.

brew install youtube-dl
brew install ffmpeg

`cd` to Desktop and pass a YouTube URL to `youtube-dl`. We’ll be downloading *A Bucket of Blood*, Roger Corman’s 1959 black comedy about beatnik culture (which happens to be in the public domain). The file will be around 300 MB, so you can substitute a shorter YouTube video if you’re close to your wi-fi bandwidth limit.

cd ~/Desktop
youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEzoCoIolJ0

To simplify things, locate the video in Finder and change its name to `Bucket.mp4`. Now let’s look at the file’s metadata with ExifTool.

exiftool Bucket.mp4

Use the `--help` option to view ExifTool’s man page, which you can also find here ()(#). Press `q` to exit the manual viewer.

exiftool --help

Next, we’ll extract a 90-second segment from the video using FFmpeg ()(#). The `-ss` option specifies start time and `-t` is the length of our new excerpt. In this case we’re creating a 90-second clip beginning 10 minutes, 11 seconds into the film.  This may take a few minutes.

ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -ss 00:10:11.0 -t 00:01:30.0 Bucket*clip.mp4

![](week/1/Image-13.png)

Instead of HH:MM:SS.S notation, we can also specify start time and/or length using seconds. The following command produces the same output as the one above.

ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -ss 701 -t 90 Bucket*clip.mp4

To re-encode a video clip when you make an excerpt, you can include the `-c copy` option.

ffmpeg -i Bucket.mp4 -c copy -ss 00:10:11.0 -t 00:01:30.0 Bucket*clip.mp4

When FFmpeg is finished, open `Bucket_clip.mp4` in VLC Media Player and see how it turned out. You may notice missing video frames or other errors.
