Choose a WAV file to work with for the following exercise, or download one and convert it to WAV using the following commands. A short recording of speech such as a poetry reading would be ideal.

```bash
wget http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Creeley/Chicago_5-15-61_Big-Table/Creeley-Robert_23_The-Warning_Chicago_5-15-61.mp3
ffmpeg Creeley-Robert_23_The-Warning_Chicago_5-15-61.mp3 Creeley-Robert_23_The-Warning_Chicago_5-15-61.wav
```

Create a new Jupyter notebook. In the first cell, let's import a few Python tools.

```
import librosa
import librosa.display
import IPython.display
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.style as ms
ms.use('seaborn-muted')
%matplotlib inline
```

Now let's load our WAV as a Librosa object.

```
wav_pathname = 'Creeley-Robert_23_The-Warning_Chicago_5-15-61.wav'

sample_array, sample_rate = librosa.load(wav_pathname)
```

We've just assigned two variables: `samples` is a numpy array of sample values; `sample_rate` is the sample rate, an integer. Print each of them and see what they look like.

By default, Librosa will resample the signal to 22050Hz. Alternatively, we can set the sample rate manually like so:

```
librosa.load(wav_pathname, sr=44100)
```

Or disable resampling and use the file's original sample rate:

```
librosa.load(wav_pathname, sr=None)
```

Now let's flip it and reverse it. In Python, we can easily reverse the order of a list called `xyz` with the bracket notation `xyz[::-1]`.

```
librosa.output.write_wav('Reverse_Creeley_The-Warning_61.wav', sample_array[::-1], sample_rate)
```

Play the new file "Reverse_Creeley_The-Warning_61.wav" in an audio editor.

Now let's add some white noise to the original recording.

```
noise_array=[]

for sample in sample_array:
noise_array.append(((random.random()-0.5)*0.1)+sample)

noise_array = np.array(noise_array)

librosa.output.write_wav('Noisy_Creeley_The-Warning_61.wav', noise_array, sample_rate)
```

For an added challenge, try mixing two recordings together.

## Plotting spectral data and MFCCs

Open a new terminal window in Jupyter and enter the following command to download the notebook you'll use for the rest of this module.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevemclaugh/HILT-Audio-ML/master/Day_1/1.8_Plotting_spectral_data_and_MFCCs_with_Librosa.ipynb
```
